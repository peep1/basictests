0006.1 Database sync, transmission parameters
    The procedure:
    1) When the Primary NCS is active, and Backup NCS is Standby, modify the "Transmission" from the Primary, and then to save it by pressing APPLY;
    2) To write down the new values of "Transmission";
    3) The database is supposed to be synchronized to the Standby NCS, so that the Standby NCS will have the same "Transmission";
    4) To do the switch for the NCS from the GUI, so that the Primary NCS is Standby, and the Backup NCS is active;
    5) To close all GUIs and wait for a while;
    6) To re-open the GUI, and check if the Backup NCS is active now;
    7) To check the "Transmission", and see if it is the same as what you wrote down.
